; steps I took to prove
; 1) w = (1-sqrt(5))/2 and theta = (1+sqrt(5))/2
; 2) used induction
; 3) proved fib(n) = (theta^n - w^n)/sqrt(5) for n=0 and n=1
; 4) assumed equality was true for n and n+1
; 5) to complete proof, had to prove for n+2
; 6) found I could separate the w and the theta and prove separately.

; ie proved   theta^n + theta^(n+1) = theta^(n+2)
; and proved  w^n + w^(n+1) = w^(n+2)
