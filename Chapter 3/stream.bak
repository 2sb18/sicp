; this program goes through each number from a to b and keeps a
; running sum of the primes

; takes up a constant in space. O(n) in time, well, actually
; could be more depending on the prime? procedure

(define (sum-primes a b)
  (define (iter count accum)
    (cond ((> count b) accum)
          ((prime? count) (iter (+ count 1) (+ count accum)))
          (else (iter (+ count 1) accum))))
  (iter a 0))



; this program creates a list from a to b, then filters it,
; creating a list of all the primes from a to b, then
; sums that list

; takes up O(n) in space

(define (sum-primes a b)
  (accumulate +
              0
              (filter prime? (enumerate-interval a b))))
