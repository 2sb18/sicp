; in data-directed programming, the type of the data is sent along with the data.

; ie '(rectangular 3 4) or '(polar 3 4)

; a package is installed for each type, which has procedures on how to deal with that type.

; this means that each operation has to take care of its own dispatching, such as

(define (deriv exp var)
  ((get 'deriv (operator exp)) (operands exp) var))
